## Inspiration
#### Have you ever wanted an easy way to sing karaoke with your friends and just don't know where to go? Well, here at The Brick Layers we've got the solution for you. Now more than ever we are looking to keep in touch with others and looking for more ways to do so. 

#### Many tv/movie streaming services have come out with the idea of watch parties to watch shows and movies with your friends. Now think of this with karaoke integrated with Spotify or YouTube Music.

#### Our application will allow friends and people to join together over karaoke. There will be a way for users to add songs to a queue and when the next song ends you will be able to vote for the next song to pick from.

#### We are using Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS along with using Spotify/YouTube Music and Dolby Atmos API.
